        <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from https://craftydesignstudios.com/ (the “Site”).
        </p>
      <h3>Personal Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
          When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” 
        </p>
      <h3>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</h3>
        <p>
          – “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
          – “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
          – “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.
          Additionally, when you purchase something from the Site, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address to complete your order and for future marketing. We do not sell any information to any third parties. We refer to this information as “Order Information.” All payments on the Site are processed through PayPal and we do not have access to your details through PayPal.
        </p>
      <h3>PayPal</h3>
        <p>
          Orders submitted on the Site are directed to PayPal for processing. We have no access to your credit card data. According to PayPal’s Privacy Policy at the time of posting this page, when you visit the PayPal website or use PayPal Services, PayPal may collect data on the pages you access, your computer IP address, device identifiers, the type of operating system you’re using, your location, mobile network information, standard web log data and other information. It may also collect information about your transactions and your activities, including contact, financial and personal information. PayPal does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. It shares with us only the billing address and order details required for order processing. For more details, see PayPal’s Privacy Policy https://www.paypal.com/en/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full
          When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.
        </p>
      <h3>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</h3>
        <p>
          We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment information, and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations).  Additionally, we use this Order Information to:

          Communicate with you;
          
          Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
          
          When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.
          
          We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns). 
        </p>
      <h3>Sharing Your Personal Information</h3>

You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here:  https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
          Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights. 
        </p>
